The original data for this project comes from the following Kaggle data set. In a previous notebook, Feature Selection, I performed a selection of the most relevant features for the prediction of traffic accident severity.

The features of the dataset resulting are the following:

In the characteristics dataset, I will keep the features: "lighting", "localisation"(agg), "type of intersection", "atmospheric conditions", "type of collisions", "department", "adress", "time" and the coordinates. I added two new features from this original dataset: "date" and "weekend" indicating if the accident occurred during the weekend or not.

In the places dataset, I will keep only the features: "road categorie", "traffic regime", "number of traffic lanes", "road profile", "road shape", "surface condition", "situation", "school nearby" and "infrastructure".

From the users dataset, I have created the following features:

num_us: total number of users involved in the accident.
ped: Wether there are pedestrians involved or not.
critic_age: If there is any user in between 17 and 31 y.o.
sev : maximum gravity suffered by any user involved in the accident:
0 = Unscathered or Light injury
1 = Hospitalized wonded or Death
I used the holiday dataset to craft a new feature indicating the accident accurred during a holiday.
